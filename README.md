# 🚢 Titanic Survival Detection

A machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on historical data. This project utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to provide survival predictions.

## 🧠 Overview

This project is based on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to build a predictive model that answers the question: **"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"** 

## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Survival prediction for test data

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Acknowledgement

I, **Mohana Sri Premnath**, would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to **CodSoft** for giving me the opportunity to work on the project **"Titanic Survival Detection"** as a part of their internship program.

This project not only helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis and machine learning but also gave me hands-on experience with real-world datasets and predictive modeling.
